# Working on huck

huck is a POSIX-ish shell written in Rust, built one numbered
iteration at a time. Before designing, planning, or listing work,
read these two docs — they're the project's authoritative source:

- **`docs/architecture.md`** — module map, key types
  (`Word`/`Sequence`/`Shell`/`VarValue`/`ExecOutcome`/etc.), the
  lex→parse→expand→execute pipeline, cross-cutting conventions
  (`process_line`, inline-assignment snapshot/restore, local-scope
  unwinding, `DeclArg` pre-parse, bash-diff harnesses), the
  iteration workflow, and a "where to add common features"
  cheatsheet (new builtin / modifier / `test` operator / control
  flow / `set -o` option / trap signal / array follow-on).

- **GitHub issues labelled [`divergence`](https://github.com/jdstanhope/huck/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Adivergence)** —
  the live tracker for every ACTIONABLE divergence from bash 5.x (bugs and
  missing features we intend to address). Filter open work by `bug` /
  `enhancement` and `sev:high` / `sev:medium` / `sev:low`. Deliberate,
  kept-by-design divergences are the closed [`by-design`](https://github.com/jdstanhope/huck/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aby-design)
  issues. **Before starting new work, review the open `divergence` issues** and
  either take an existing one or open a new issue to capture the work.

- **`docs/bash-divergences.md`** — the INTENTIONAL (kept-by-design)
  divergences only, each linking to its closed `by-design` issue. Actionable
  divergences are NOT here — they live in the GitHub issue tracker (above).
  Resolved divergences and the per-iteration history are in git history and
  `docs/superpowers/` specs+plans.

The README's iteration table indexes the v1–vNN history at a glance.
For per-iteration design context, `docs/superpowers/specs/` and
`docs/superpowers/plans/` hold the paper trail (one pair per `vNN`).

## When the user says "start vNN: <feature>"

Run the standard iteration loop without being asked:

0. **Pick up (or open) an issue.** Review the open [`divergence`](https://github.com/jdstanhope/huck/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adivergence)
   issues. Take the existing issue that matches the work, or open a new one
   (`gh issue create`, labels `divergence` + `bug`/`enhancement` +
   `sev:*`) to capture it. Note the issue number — the PR will close it.
1. **Brainstorm** via the `superpowers:brainstorming` skill — ask
   one question at a time, propose 2-3 approaches, present design
   in sections with per-section approval.
2. **Write spec** to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
   and commit on main.
3. **Write plan** to `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`
   via `superpowers:writing-plans` and commit on main.
4. **Implement** via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` on a
   `vNN-<topic>` branch: fresh subagent per task with spec + code
   quality review between tasks.
5. **Final review** of the whole branch diff before merge.
6. **Open a pull request** (`gh pr create`) targeting `main`, with the body
   referencing the issue via `Closes #N`, and hand it to the user to review
   and merge — do NOT merge to main yourself. Push the `vNN-<topic>` branch
   to origin so the PR has a head. Before opening the PR, update the docs +
   memory as part of the branch:
   - If the work resolved a divergence, the merged PR auto-closes its issue
     (`Closes #N`); no edit to `docs/bash-divergences.md` is needed unless the
     resolved item was **intentional** (then remove it there too). Open a new
     `divergence` issue for any follow-on gap discovered.
   - If the work adds a NEW intentional divergence, add it to
     `docs/bash-divergences.md` and open + close a `by-design` issue for it.
   - Record the iteration in the long-running memory files
     (`project_huck_iterations.md` + `MEMORY.md`). (The README no longer
     carries a per-version table.)

## Conventions

- **Commit trailer**: every commit ends with
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
  The "(1M context)" parenthetical is canonical; do not remove it. (Update
  the model version to match whichever Claude model is doing the work; was
  4.7 through v136, 4.8 from v137.)
- **Bash-diff harnesses** under `tests/scripts/*_diff_check.sh` run
  the same fragments through bash and huck and assert byte-identical
  output. Adding a `<feature>_diff_check.sh` is the gold standard
  for verifying bash compat on a new feature.
- **Don't push directly to main, and don't merge PRs yourself.** Iteration
  work lands via a pull request that the user reviews and merges. Push the
  feature branch and open the PR (`Closes #N`); leave the merge to the user.
